# short-godot-demo
Autoloads, Save &amp; Load, Pause Menu, RNG

This is a game jam submission for [Make an Open Source Project for Godot Jam]. The intention is to give an open-source
project of something to help others from; Games, Modules, Add-ons, etc. This is my first ever game jam submission and a
way for me to think of what I struggled on and what I would have liked to know more about.

For me I had trouble with Autoloads, Saving and Loading, Pause Menu, and RNG. I choose to give a short sort-of concise
demo about these topics and which will help others. In fact, I feel a little annoyed at myself for the poor job of how
well this is done there is so much things I could have improved upon. But, my month is busy and I cannot risk working
and forgetting to upload this project.

Therefore I am uploading pretty early (16 days before deadline). At first I wanted to make a game yet I haven't "made"
one yet that is why I pivoted to certain sections that I had struggled on when I was learning the Godot engine.

Here is my game jam hope you learn something out of this.
