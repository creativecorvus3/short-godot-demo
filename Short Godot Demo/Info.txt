# Save Folder

I use the game's name for custom dir, here is where the saves folder will be at


# Input Map
Go to > Project > ProjectSettings > Input Map > Add New Action 
you name this something like "left", "right" and on the right
side is a plus sign click it and add the corresponding keys you
want to be assigned to the action you named


# Autoload
Go to > Project > ProjectSettings > Autoloads here you can add
the scenes, scripts, etc. that you need for access across the game
